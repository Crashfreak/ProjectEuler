#Project Euler

This mini project solves the math problems that are found at http://projecteuler.net.
It provides a very small framework for solving the problems, and so you would simply do the following to start solving a problem.

* Create a class with the name "Problem" + [Euler Problem Number] + ".class" and extend the class EulerProblem.
* Implement the run method.
* Write you code and use the answer(ans:Object) function to print the answer to the console.
* It has an Idea project setup that you can use, but you could really use anything.
